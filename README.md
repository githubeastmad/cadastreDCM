# cadastreDCM

This repository provides two demonstrative scenarios for the paper "Evaluating the Applicability of Digital Cartographic Model 1 for 3D Cadastre Mapping
". The first example is based on a vitural scenario, and the second one is based on a real urban cadastre scenario. Each example folder contains a XML encoded cadastre DLM, a XML encoded SE file, a COLLADA encoded GC file, and a 3D PDF file.
